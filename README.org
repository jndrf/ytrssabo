#+TITLE: RSS-based local Youtube Abonnements

Tool to automatically download new videos of select Youtube channels for local viewing, based on [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][~yt-dlp~]].
* Installation
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/jndrf/ytrssabo.git
  pip install --user requirements.txt
  #+END_SRC
* Configuration
  The script ~ytrssabo.py~ expects a configuration file either as command-line argument or in ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ytrssabo/ytrssabo.cfg~.
  For an example, see ~feedreader.cfg~ in this repository.
  The section ~[Channels]~ contains a list of channel names (which can be arbitrary and just name the output folder) and the corresponding rss feed, e.g.
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  [Channels]
  Louis Rossman: https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w
  #+END_SRC
  You can obtain the URL of the RSS feed from the channel overview page with
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ./get_feed_url.py https://www.youtube.com/@rossmanngroup
  #+END_SRC

  By default, downloaded videos will be stored in per-channel subfolders of =~/Videos/ytrssabo=.
  A list of already downloaded videos is kept in =~/.local/share/ytrssabo/archives=.
** Configuring yt-dlp
   ~yt-dlp~ has many different options describe in [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L190]].
   They can be specified in the configuration file in a section ~[DownloaderOptions]~, which contents will be passed verbatim to ~yt-dlp~.
